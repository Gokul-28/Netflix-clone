This project is a simple front-end clone of the Netflix website, built using vanilla HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project was to practice my HTML and CSS skills by emulating the visual design and layout of the Netflix landing page.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The clone is responsive and optimized for various screen sizes, ranging from desktop to mobile devices.
- **Movie Thumbnails:** The project showcases a variety of movie and TV show thumbnails, resembling the style of Netflix.
- **Navigation Bar:** A simplified navigation bar is included, resembling the original Netflix navigation menu.
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox:** The layout is structured using a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox to achieve the desired arrangement.
- **Minimalistic Design:** The project aims to capture the minimalist design approach of the official Netflix UI.
